# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
Hello my name is Matthew Kim and I am a beginning programmer studying at the UCI Coding Bootcamp. This password generator was created to familiarize myself with javascript. This program (once clicked) will prompt the user for some options on creating their password such as the size and what type of characters you want. If your input doesn't answer the question correctly an error message will display and you will have to start the program over again. 
Here if a screenshot of the functioning webpage with the program.
